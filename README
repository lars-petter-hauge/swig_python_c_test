Each example contains a build script, which will compile and link.

In order to use the libraries, it is necessary to add the output folder
to PYTHONPATH (note that cwd is always added to pythonpath)

The skbuild setup will install the files to your environment, but it is
necessary to add the lib folder to LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to find all
libraries
----------
Debug:

To have lldb be able to set breakpoint in a dynamically loaded library, preload the image:
lldb python
image add <name>.so

then continue to set breakpoint where appropriate
